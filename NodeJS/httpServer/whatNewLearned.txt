learned about node module wrapper 
generally ye seekha ki jo ham require,  exports, module etc use karte hai woh kaise kaam karta hai 

generally node use ek iife me store karke rakhta hai jiska syntax kuch is tarah hota hai

(funciton(require, exports, module, __dirname, __filename){
// Your Code here
})();

and u can read more about it from net.


Learned an additional thing about http server that 
in the space of localhost we can write (127.0.0.1) because its our server host number 

// We can also use 127.0.0.1 this method instead of localhost to listen on port

// to listen on Browser

// localhost:2000
// 127.0.0.1:2000
(also if you remember) vsCode live extension also uses this port to show live server
